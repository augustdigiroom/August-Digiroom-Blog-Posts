# Getting Started with AWS Lambda Functions

In todayâ€™s cloud-native world, **serverless computing** has become one of the most popular paradigms for building scalable applications. One of the most widely used serverless services is **AWS Lambda**.

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. Instead of worrying about infrastructure, you simply upload your code, configure a trigger, and Lambda handles the rest.

Key characteristics of AWS Lambda:

- **No server management** â€“ AWS manages scaling and infrastructure for you.
- **Pay only for what you use** â€“ you are billed based on the number of requests and execution time.
- **Event-driven execution** â€“ Lambda is triggered by events such as an API Gateway request, an S3 file upload, or a DynamoDB table update.

## How Lambda Works

1. You upload a function (code written in Python, Node.js, Java, Go, or other supported languages).
2. Configure a trigger (such as HTTP request via API Gateway).
3. AWS Lambda executes the function when triggered.
4. You are billed only for the compute time consumed during execution.

Hereâ€™s a simple **Node.js Lambda function** example:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const name = event.name || "World";
    const message = `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to AWS Lambda.`;
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message }),
    };
};
```

If you invoke this function with:

```json
{
  "name": "August"
}
```

Youâ€™ll get the response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, August! Welcome to AWS Lambda."
}
```

## Common Use Cases

AWS Lambda can be used in many real-world scenarios:

- **Web APIs** â€“ Build serverless APIs with Amazon API Gateway + Lambda.
- **Data processing** â€“ Automatically process files uploaded to S3.
- **Database triggers** â€“ React to changes in DynamoDB tables.
- **Scheduled tasks** â€“ Run cron jobs using CloudWatch Events.

## Advantages of AWS Lambda

- Cost-efficient for workloads with variable demand.
- Auto-scaling with no manual configuration.
- Seamless integration with other AWS services.

## Final Thoughts

AWS Lambda is a powerful way to build modern applications without managing infrastructure. Whether you are building microservices, APIs, or data pipelines, Lambda provides a cost-effective and scalable solution.

# Getting Started with AWS DynamoDB

When building modern applications, you often need a database that is **fast, scalable, and highly available**. AWS DynamoDB is a fully managed **NoSQL database** service that checks all these boxes.

In this post, weâ€™ll explore what DynamoDB is, why itâ€™s popular, and how you can start using it.

## What is DynamoDB?

DynamoDB is a **key-value and document database** service provided by AWS. Unlike traditional relational databases, DynamoDB doesnâ€™t use tables with rows and columnsâ€”it uses **tables with items** (similar to JSON objects), making it more flexible for unstructured or semi-structured data.

Key features of DynamoDB:

- **Fully managed** â€“ no servers to maintain.
- **Highly scalable** â€“ automatically handles millions of requests per second.
- **Low latency** â€“ designed for millisecond response times.
- **Built-in security & backup** â€“ with encryption and point-in-time recovery.

## DynamoDB Core Concepts

Before diving in, letâ€™s look at some important concepts:

- **Table** â€“ A collection of items (similar to a table in SQL).
- **Item** â€“ A record in a table (like a row).
- **Attribute** â€“ A piece of data (like a column).
- **Primary Key** â€“ A unique identifier for each item (can be a simple key or a composite key).

## Example: Creating a DynamoDB Table

Letâ€™s say you want to store user profiles. Your table might look like this:

**Table Name:** `Users`  
**Primary Key:** `userId` (string)

Hereâ€™s how a user item might look in DynamoDB:

```json
{
  "userId": "12345",
  "name": "August Digiroom",
  "email": "august@example.com",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-28T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Writing and Reading Data with DynamoDB (Node.js Example)

Hereâ€™s a simple example using the AWS SDK for JavaScript:

```javascript
import AWS from "aws-sdk";

const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

// Insert a new user
export const createUser = async () => {
  const params = {
    TableName: "Users",
    Item: {
      userId: "12345",
      name: "August Digiroom",
      email: "august@example.com",
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  };

  await dynamodb.put(params).promise();
  console.log("User created successfully!");
};

// Get user by ID
export const getUser = async (id) => {
  const params = {
    TableName: "Users",
    Key: { userId: id }
  };

  const result = await dynamodb.get(params).promise();
  console.log(result.Item);
};
```

## Common Use Cases

DynamoDB is widely used in real-world applications:

- **E-commerce** â€“ product catalogs, shopping carts, and order history.
- **Gaming** â€“ storing player sessions and leaderboards.
- **IoT** â€“ managing data streams from connected devices.
- **Web & Mobile Apps** â€“ user profiles, authentication sessions, and preferences.

## Advantages of DynamoDB

âœ… **Scalable** â€“ handles huge workloads automatically  
âœ… **Serverless** â€“ no need to manage servers or clusters  
âœ… **Cost-effective** â€“ pay for read/write units and storage  
âœ… **Global tables** â€“ multi-region replication for global apps  

## Final Thoughts

AWS DynamoDB is a **powerful and flexible NoSQL database** that fits perfectly into serverless and high-performance applications. Whether youâ€™re building a startup project or an enterprise-scale system, DynamoDB can scale with your needs while keeping your application responsive.
